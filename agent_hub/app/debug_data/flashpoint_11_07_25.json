        "description": "Barry Callebaut, a Zurich-based chocolate giant, reported a steep drop in Q3 FY25 results, with global chocolate volumes decreasing by -5.1% and cocoa volumes by -11.3%. Revenue growth was +56.7% in local currencies and +49.5% in CHF for the first nine months. Cocoa prices have swung wildly, up 43% year-on-year before a sudden correction, causing challenges for Barry Callebaut\'s cost-plus pricing model, which has proven slower than expected in adapting to these sharp changes. Barry Callebaut has recovered roughly 50% of cost increases in H1, but long-term B2B contracts and the gourmet division are slow to adjust. Feld\'s team is negotiating with clients to shorten payment cycles and move toward more dynamic pricing models. Barry Callebaut\'s balance sheet shows mounting pressure, with inventory levels surging, net working capital nearly doubling, operating cash flow sinking to negative CHF 2 billion, and net debt climbing to CHF 6.1 billion. Agencies like Moody\'s and S&P have sounded the alarm due to persistent cash flow and leverage concerns. Net debt/EBITDA stands at an alarming 8x, far from the group\\u2019s historical average of 3-4x. Barry Callebaut\'s flagship transformation initiative, BC Next Level, is now 12 months behind schedule, aiming for CHF 250 million in annual savings, with 75% expected to impact EBITDA.",
